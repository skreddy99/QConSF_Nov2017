You should bring you laptop with Tensorflow installed (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
Have a python IDE installed. I prefer version 2016.3 (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/previous.html)
Install Anaconda Navigator. This will help you install certain basic packages like Numpy, Pandas, Keras, etc. (https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)
